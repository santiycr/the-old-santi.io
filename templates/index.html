    I seek learning and personal growth.<br>
    I build complex systems and tools I enjoy using.<br>
    I thrive when I'm challenged and as part of a small team.<br>
    I work with great people. I respect and communicate with them.<br>
    I love what I do. I do my best to "work to live" and not the opposite.
